The above link is a link to my CS470 final presentation. This course has helped me gain knowledge in applications that are hosted on the cloud. Since learning how the cloud environments work, it has exposed me to various methods that can be used from a hacker which would aid me in my career field I am pursuing which is cyber security. I have also been exposed to tools such as Docker, Mongodb, DyanmoDB and Amazon's web hosting services such as Lambda functions.

Being able to create applications can help identify potential threats for companies which will aid in pursuing a career in the cyber security field. Some of the skills I gained was being patient and ensuring I use the most up to date standards when creating applications. Another key trait I strengthened is my attention to detail which is crucial especially when coding since one missed syntax can throw off an entire application. It is important to reread your code and ensure no typos are there as well as the desired functionality is acheieved so no one can maliciously take advantage of it. I beleive these traits and experiences should assist me in becoming a cyber security analyst or a network engineer.

Servless cloud hosting can be beneficial to the company since they will not need to worry about the development of the server or anything with hosting it. They just need to pay for the service and companies such as Amazon can take care of the rest. An added benefit of servless cloud hosting is its scalability as efficiency. Companies can quickly scale up if needed based off of the business needs. Another feature is that you pay for what you use so it makes it easier to predict what you will need to pay instead of shelling out the cost for continously hosting a server for the application. I would say that the serverless hosting would be more predicatble as opposed to the containers even though both are low resources and efficient. Containers would allow the developers to perform the same scalability but they are managing the servers which will require time and money to manage. These types of traits are good in making the decisions in expanding or determining which services to go with. For one, you can just pay the money and have a peace of mind or you can try and host it yourself but then you have to worry about scaling the server which includes determine the hardware such as storage, CPU and ram needed.
